# next-typescript

The objective of this boilerplate is to set up everything the developer will need (in terms of configuration) to start a next + typescript project. Eslint, prettier and husky are configured to work independant of the user's IDE configuration (as long as it's vscode).

## Featured aspects of the stack

- Typescript
- Next.JS

## Things to note

- It comes with Inter (it's better to host fonts here rather than getting them from google fonts). Remove it if you are not going to use it.
- Pages, components, etc... are located under `/src`.

## To use it

1. Clone repo

```
git clone https://github.com/basementstudio/next-typescript.git <your-project-name>
```

2. Remove remote origin

```
git remote rm origin
```

3. Add the origin of your new repo

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

3. Start

```
yarn && yarn dev
```
